# LAZClassroomPolling
This repository contains files from my 2020 internship with Learning A-Z, 
where I built its first classroom polling feature where teachers can send
polls to their students and have the students respond in their messages 
portal. Since this code was integrated into other existing code, I have extracted the files I developed 
here.
